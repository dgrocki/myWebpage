    cplusplus: "C++ is the programming language that is taught in the first year at OSU. A significant amount of time in this class is spent on pointers and memory management. After my freshman year, I became a teacher assistant for this course. I have done this for the past 3 years and have helped many students through this course. This has greatly improved my communication skills when it comes to explaining complicated ideas in simple ways. This has also given me plenty of time to practice C++ and keep the important parts of the language fresh in my mind. ",
    csharp: "I first used C# at my internship at U.S. Bank. There, I created a Windows Form application that pulled data about servers from various locations and brought it together in an easily searchable application. I then used C# again to create and API for a React application at CDK Global. During this project, I helped create HTTP endpoints and connect the API to a Postgress database. ",
    react: "I learned ReactJS during my time at CDK Global. Our goal was to modernize an older application to improve usability. We used React to create a user interface in conjunction with MaterialUI. We used .NET Core to create an API for the UI to communicate with. Redux was used on the frontend to help deal with the data coming from the database and manage the data being modified in the UI. In addition to my experiences at CDK Global using React, I have also practiced my skills by making this page using React.",
    docker: "I have been interested in Docker ever since I first learned about it my first year of college. Since then, I have listened to several talks by members of the Linux Users Group about Docker and Kubernetes. I have also had the opportunity to take the System Administration class offered at OSU. In this class, we explored Docker as well as the configuration management tool Ansible. One project we worked on was to use Ansible to provision several Docker Containers as webservers and start them.\n My senior project also involved Docker. The client for my project was HP. My teamâ€™s job was to use Docker and Kubernetes to help containerize services used for printing to help use resources more effectively. ",
    linux: "I have been the Secretary of the Linux Users Group for the past 3 years. As an officer in this club, I have helped people install and learn about Linux. As a teacher assistant, I have also had the opportunity to teach students about how Linux works and explaining commands to them. \n I have written various shell scripts to help improve productivity. For example, I created a Bash script that helped update the club calendar with upcoming meeting info. "
